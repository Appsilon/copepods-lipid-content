These files may appear uniformly black at first glance, but they are in fact [segmentation masks](https://inside-machinelearning.com/en/plot-segmentation-mask/). In these masks, pixels representing oil sacs in copepods are labeled with a value of 1, while all other pixels are set to 0. 

In grayscale imagery, pixel values can range from 0 to 255. As a result, the value of 1, indicative of an oil sac, manifests as an extremely dark shade of grey, almost indistinguishable to the naked eye.
